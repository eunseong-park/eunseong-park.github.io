**Applied Equilibrium Analysis in Environmental and Energy Economics**, Heidelberg University (Prof. Dr. Sebastian Rausch)

Teaching assistant with supervision of group projects (Winter 2024/25, Winter 2025/26). Students analyze emissions reduction pathways in the global steel industry using partial equilibrium models, evaluating climate policy instruments (carbon taxes, ETS, technology standards) and the effectiveness of Border Carbon Adjustments in mitigating carbon leakage.

* **[Group Project Repository](https://github.com/eunseong-park/steel-decarbonization)**  
  Codebase with equivalent implementations in GAMS, Python (GAMSPy/Pyomo), and Julia (JuMP) for modeling heterogeneous steel plants and simulating climate policies.
